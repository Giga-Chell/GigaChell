> 42 minishell project by [@ethebaul](https://github.com/CyberOne) x [@ebini](https://github.com/saumon-brule)

The minishell project aims to reproduce most basic shell behavior. This includes pipe, redirection, here doc and environment variables (setting and expanding).
This will provide us important knowledge about how basic Unix mechanisms such as pipes, signals, processus and obviously **shell** work. \
Minishell is also the first group project of 42, introducing team woking and use of git as a tool to handle versionning and provide an efficient workflow between students
